You can use the command line args (see below) or the GUI in bot to set proxy info, the GUI is located at" File -> Proxy"

Usage:
java -jar parafork.jar -proxy TYPE IP PORT

TYPE can be one of 3 things (case insensitive):
	HTTP
	SOCKSV5
	SOCKSV4

HTTP proxies can be used to tunnel TCP connections, but many implementations block all ports except 443, if this happens you'll want to find a different proxy
