It's very simple to use ParaFork's proxy implementation, as it currently stands it is only though the command line. A GUI is in the works.

Usage:
java -jar parafork.jar -proxy TYPE IP PORT

TYPE can be one of 3 things (case insensitive):
	HTTP
	SOCKSV5
	SOCKSV4

HTTP proxies can be used to tunnel TCP connections, but many implementations block all ports except 443, if this happens you'll want to find a different proxy
