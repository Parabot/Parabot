# ParaFork

Based on Parabot v2.04.

#### Website

#### Compilation

No external libraries are needed to compile ParaFork

#### Diferences
- No python
- "Debug" mode removed, local and remote scripts and servers are loaded at the same time
- Removed forum login needed
- A better proxy implementation (lower level, more difficult for the server's client to detect), HTTP, SOCKSv5, SOCKSv4 are now supported! see: docs/proxy-usage.txt for how to use
